# 🛡️ Responsible Disclosures by OpenIntelHunter

This repository contains my passive reconnaissance and responsible disclosure reports.

As **OpenIntelHunter**, I focus on identifying misconfigured or exposed internet-facing systems — particularly in Latin America — using **public tools** and **ethical methods** such as:

- 🔍 Shodan
- 📡 Nmap / Masscan
- 🛠️ cURL / OpenSSL / WHOIS
- 🔐 SSL certificate analysis
- 🌍 ASN and IP ownership mapping

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This project is about **learning**, **exposure awareness**, and **responsible security research**. I document these discoveries as part of my growth in cybersecurity and OSINT, while respecting legal and ethical boundaries.

## ⚖️ Ethics & Disclosure

All findings are from **public sources** only.  
I do **not exploit**, modify, or harm any system.  
If login access is encountered (e.g., via default credentials), I document and **exit immediately**, then report it to the owner or ISP.
